            <h2> Everyone knows about positive Search Engine Optimization, but what causes negative optimization and
                what is its impact?</h2>
           
            <p>This blog will explain what negative SEO is, what it causes, and the impact it can have.</p>
            <p>Google and other search engines visit pages and review their content to determine when to display them
                when someone is searching for information. They take into account the page's title, text, and semantic
                HTML tags used. If these things are not in order on a site, it can result in a (drastic) drop in search
                engine rankings. Below are various examples of what can cause negative SEO.</p>
            <h2>Title doesn't match the content</h2>
            <p>Search engines have become so smart that they understand the content of a page. When the page's title,
                the "H1" title, and the content don't match, it can result in negative SEO.</p>
            <h2>Missing HTML tags</h2>
            <p>One of the most important tags that should <strong>never</strong> be missing from a page is the
                &lt;h1&gt; tag. For search engines, this is a critical element on a site and should represent the page's
                content. If this tag and title are missing, a 'crawler' or 'spider,' programs that automatically view a
                page, will have trouble determining what the page is really about.</p>
            <h2>Wrong "Document Outline"</h2>
            <p>Another critical aspect of a page is the "Document Outline," which can be compared to a book:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every book has a title, which is the &lt;H1&gt; tag on the page.</li>
                <li>The text in a book is divided into chapters, the &lt;H2&gt; tags in the HTML.</li>
                <li>Under chapters, there can be paragraphs, the &lt;H3&gt; tags in the HTML.</li>
                <li>Each paragraph that belongs to another paragraph is given a subsequent number: &lt;H4&gt; --&gt;
                    &lt;H5&gt; --&gt; &lt;H6&gt;.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The document outline on a page should look like this:</p>

            <h2>Commonly Used "Tricks"</h2>
            <p>In the past, it was possible to apply tricks to a page to gain an advantage in search engines.
                Fortunately, crawlers are getting smarter and can detect these tricks. Below are some of these tricks.
            </p>
            <h2>Text color equal to background</h2>
            <p>Having a lot of content on a page is good for SEO, but often unrelated content was also added. This also
                resulted in a better position. To make sure visitors didn't see this content, the color of the text was
                made the same as the background. This made the text invisible to visitors, but visible to crawlers.</p>
            <h2>Adjusting position</h2>
            <p>Another way to make unrelated content invisible to visitors was to position this text off-screen.
                Visitors have no idea that this text exists, but crawlers think it adds value to the page.</p>
            <h2>Adding tags</h2>
            <p>Pages also used a list of "tags". The tags were individual words that, like the previous points, gave
                crawlers the impression that they added value.</p>
            <p>All these "tricks" no longer work because crawlers have learned to recognize these techniques and give
                negative marks on search results.</p>
            <p>It is important to consider the content on a site and how this content is displayed. There are many more
                ways in which a site can contain negative or positive SEO. In the next blog, examples will be given of
                how a site or page contains positive SEO.</p>
